A simple way to manage sets of shell aliases and mods
http://github.com/lsd/shwagger

#### USAGE
Add or remove 'sets' from your Shwagfile.
Make sure they exist with read permission in sets/ dir

Save the file and source reload.sh
$ sh ./reload.sh

or open a new shell instance and the
Shwagfile will be reflected automatically.

#### NOTES
This was tested on OS X 10.7+ and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
with bash on both OSes.
